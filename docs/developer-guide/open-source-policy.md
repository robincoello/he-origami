# Higher Ed Open Source Release Policy

Pearson Higher Ed supports appropriate release of software we develop internally as open source.

Releasing our code has a number of benefits:

- Recruiting—developer candidates can see our code, and we can evaluate candidates based on their contributions.
- Improves recognition and reputation of Pearson as a technology pioneer.
- Can lead to suggestions and improvements that are contributed by external developers, free of charge.
- Enables access for third party contractors who are unable to access internal source control systems.
- Enables access to online services that can be used free of charge, such as GitHub and Travis CI.
- Encourages cross-team collaboration by adopting a community approach to software development.

However, not all of our software can be released—projects may contain content that is:

- Private intellectual property and/or commercially sensitive
- Protected under agreements with third parties that prohibit redistribution
- Credentials and/or other secrets that if disclosed would lead to security vulnerabilities. (Note, however, that the practice of committing secrets should be discouraged).

Please review the [full policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SiSTomsnjLvFEXX7pPnyMHxTyMKcahUlIhaJQkG40vw/) prior to releasing any software as open source.
